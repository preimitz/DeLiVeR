# DeLiVeR: Decays of Light Vectors Revised

by Ana Luisa Foguel, Peter Reimitz, and Renata Zukanovich Funchal

## Introduction

We provide a numerical package to calculate decay quantities of light vector particles. It includes the calcualtion of decay widths, and branching ratios for all leptonic and almost all hadronic decays as well as decays to some exemplary dark matter models. Those quantities are needed to set constraints on vector mediator models in the GeV and sub-GeV range.

## Paper

In our main paper, we provide the theoretical background of our calculations and some examples where our results can be used.

## Tutorial

In the main folder of this repository, there is a jupyter notebook tutorial called `tutorial.ipynb` that should
help with using this code.
